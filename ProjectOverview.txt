The Other 2D- project overview and plans

Scenes
	global_variables
		This is autoloaded.
		It contains a list of every scene, including the main menu and the scene for beating the game.
		It has functions to change between these scenes.
		Call them within a menu or level scene.
	main_menu
		This has a label, a level selection menu, and a start button.
	Levels
		test_level is the only one so far.
		Make sure each new level you add is added to the list in global_variables.
		Each level should include these prefabs:
			clock
			level_title
			random_color_bg
			player
			enemy_linear (if used)
			Some planks
				Not a prefab, but a StaticBody2D with a ColorRect and a CollisionShape2D
				See test_level
		Make sure everything in the level is on the right layer.
	end_game_screen
		This is the screen that will show once you finish the game.
		It has a button to return to the main menu.
	
Prefabs (technically just scenes):
	player
		The player-character. Moves to the right at a constant rate and can jump.
		Sound effects are also processed by this.
	enemy_linear
		This is used for enemies that move along a linear path.
		It can also be used for moving platforms, as long as you change the sprite,
		collision mask, and what layer it's on.
		Make sure to go into Inspector and add the clock to the Clock field.
	clock
		This checks for the time controls and displays them in the form of a UI clock face.
	random_color_bg
		This creates a rectangle in the background that's a random color.
		This color is in HSL form where only the H is random,
		which ensures that you can still read the text.
	level_title
		Displays the number of the level, taken from global_variables.
	key
		This has no scripting: it's just a StaticBody2D on the key layer.
	about_menu
		This is the about menu.
		It's used in main_menu.
	
Scripts
	main_menu, end_game_screen
		These just control the buttons on those menus.
		They check for global_variables and use that for scene changes.
	global_variables
		See the global_variables scene for a description.
	clock
		Handles time controls and displaying the time.
		This also handles other controls, such as resetting the level and muting.
	player
		Handles physics that move the player, as well as the jump controls.
		This also handles the player's collisions.
	linear_clock_motion
		Used on enemy_linear to move it along a line according to the clock.
